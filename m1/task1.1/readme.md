### DevOps

I can say, DevOps is a kind of culture of behavior, when everyone tries to do 
everything to solve the problem or eliminate shortcomings. In production, the 
Devops engineer occupies an intermediate place between developers and production.
In my opinion, Devops-engineer must first understand the processes occurring in the
development-production cycle, be able to quickly find ways to solve new problems.
